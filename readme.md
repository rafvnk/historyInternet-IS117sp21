1.  Material Design is a set of User Interface Guidlines that define what web applications and mobile applications look like and how they function i.e. don't reinvent the wheel.  Material design is used to develop web, android, and even iOS applications (note IOS has their own guidelines for Native iOS but cross platform apps will use Material Design).
2.  Bootstrap is a code framework for making responsive web appications i.e. working on desktop and mobile that you can implement a design that follows the Material Design guidelines (MD)
3.  You don't need to use material design right but you do need to use F and Z layouts
