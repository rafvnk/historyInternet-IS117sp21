Material design is used to develop web, android, and even iOS applications (note IOS has their own guidelines for Native iOS but cross platform apps will use Material Design).
2.  Bootstrap is a code framework for making responsive web appications i.e. working on desktop and mobile that you can implement a design that follows the Material Design guidelines (MD)
